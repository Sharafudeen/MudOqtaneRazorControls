# MudBlazor Wrapped Oqtane Razor Component Library [MudOqtaneRazorControls - MORC]

## Overview
This project is a Razor Component Library utilizing MudBlazor to wrap existing Oqtane User controls. The primary motivation behind this endeavor is the inherent difficulty in overriding or inheriting from the Oqtane Framework directly. By encapsulating Oqtane controls within MudBlazor components, we aim to provide a more flexible and customizable approach for developers working within the Oqtane ecosystem.

## Features
- **MudBlazor Integration**: Leveraging MudBlazor's extensive set of UI components for building responsive web applications.
- **Encapsulation of Oqtane Controls**: Oqtane controls are encapsulated within MudBlazor components, providing an easier pathway for customization.
- **Improved Extensibility**: By utilizing MudBlazor, developers gain enhanced extensibility options compared to the native Oqtane controls.
